	<h1>Chapter 4: Demolition</h1>
	<h4>You choose to leave the jewel.</h4>
	<h4>You realize that if anyone would have wanted to take the jewel, they would have already done so. You examinate the room and you find words written into the stone:</h4>

	<p>"To anyone traveling through the caves: I, a warrior from the Mountain Leauge, have inspected the forgotten caves for a couple of months now, and it seems that the energy of the jewel is keeping the caves from falling, so please DO NOT remove the jewel from its place. It also seems as the energy of the jewel has an impact on your nervous system. I have felt strange while being in the caves, like my body won't obey me. Probably a defensive system from the jewel.</p>
	<p>I have decided to stay in the caves, to be a part of the defensive system the jewel creates to stop other power-hungry minds that wants to take it. Long live the Mountain Leauge."</p>

	<h4>You decide you want to do the same as the warrior. Not because you want to. Because it's the right thing to do.</h4>
