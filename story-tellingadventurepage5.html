	<h1>Chapter 2: Encounter</h1>
	<h4>You walk through the ruins of the mountain with your dagger ready in your hand. After a few minutes, you come across a cave bathing in light. Through the mist, you see a door that you recognize is made from the forests of the wood elfs. Beside it, you see a passage that leads you through an icy path.</h4>

  	<h4>You don't know what is behind the door, but you know it could be something worth bringing on your journey, or something that could lead your death.</h4>

  	<h5>Press <a href="">here</a> if you choose to open the door.</h5>
  	<h5>Press <a href="">here</a> if you choose to take the icy path.</h5>
