<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h4>You, a brave warrior of the Mountain Leauge, have decided to explore the forgotten caves of Oblitus Tenebris, once the most majestetic mountain in the world before a mysterious cause destroyed it. A rumor was spread that there is a jewel of mass energy inside the remains of the mountain that makes its wearer invincible, and your objective is to find it and take it for yourself.</h4>
<h4>The fallen mountain is not empty, though. Legend has it that the mountain crawls with creatures of the dark, protecting the jewel. No one knows why.</h4>
