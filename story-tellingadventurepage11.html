	<h1>Chapter 3: Encounter</h1>
	<h4>You walk through the icy passage, and it takes you to a dark cave. According to your magic wayfinder the Mountain Leauge made for you, the jewel is very close. Right after you step into the dark cave, a creature comes out of the dark. You notice the clothes it is wearing; the jacket is from the Mountain Leauge! He must have been a former member of the leauge, but must have been brainwashed; his eyes are staring at you, and his mouth is drooling, similarly to a zombie.</h4>

  	<h4>The warrior begins to walk towards you, and you know based on his expression that he wants harm.</h4>
